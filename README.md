# Example Site: Data Abstraction in Gatsby Themes

This is a simplified site using [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/). It uses [`@jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-style`](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-style) and is, in effect, a folder full of Markdown files.

Eventually, a post explaining how this works will be posted at <https://lengstorf.com/code/data-abstraction-in-apps/>
